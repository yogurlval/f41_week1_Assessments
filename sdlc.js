// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// ANSWER:
// Planning
//Analysis of Requirements
//Design
//Implementation
//Testing & Integration
//Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step in which you gather relevant information from the customer or client and determine the purpose of the product, what they want to build, and the specifics. Once requirements have been gathered, we analyze all the information to make sure it can be done."
const design = "This is the third step in which you plan the design of the product."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step in which the coder gets the designs and starts implementing the code."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step in which the code is complete and starts to be tested. It will be tested thoroughly for any bugs, if any are found they go back to the developers to be fixed."
const maintain = "This is the final step (that goes on forever), after the product is released, it will need to be maintained as any issues come up the developers will fix or enhance the product with updates."
